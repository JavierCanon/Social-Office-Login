# Social Office Login

This is a login library for .net 
 

## What does it Do? 

This utility enables users to log in on your website using the single sign on capability.

The main social networks are available out of the box, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft Live, Yahoo and Twitter. The goal of this project is to have a simple and flexible tool that retrieves the email address of the user who logged in using one of the available social network, and then, use that email to integrate easily with the ASP.NET Membership provider.

This library was made because OAuth libraries available on the net today are usually too complicated, and often depend on other libraries. Sometimes you just need a secure login to identify the user, and nothing more... 

This is a simple tool because it retrieves the user's email address and nothing else.
This is a flexible tool because it lets you add service providers very easily.

The available authentication protocols are OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID.

## Philosophy of Javier Cañon
* KISS by design and programming. An acronym for "keep it simple, stupid" or "keep it stupid simple", is a design principle. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", or "keep it stupid simple".

* Select the best tools for the job, use tools that take less time to finish the job.
* Productivity over complexity and avoid unnecessary complexity for elegant or beauty code.

* Computers are machines, more powerful every year, give them hard work, concentrate on being productive.
